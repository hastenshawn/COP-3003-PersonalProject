Peronal Project for COP 3003

# Haunted Zillow

The project is for finding haunted properties in the United States that are for sale

# 1. Creating a starting database
  Using the Haunted API to get a start on available properties. Unforunately this only supplies long. and lat. coordinates.

# 2. Get physical addresses
  Use the google maps api to reverse geolocate address and build databases with properties
  
# 3. Reference Zillow API
  Using the addresses given from google api reference the zillow api to grab property values
  
# 4. Creating maps
  Using google maps api to build out a maps with a pin for every available location along with a "balloon" with a name of the property and how it is haunted
